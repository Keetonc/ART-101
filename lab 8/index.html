	  <h1> Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
	  <h2>Challenge</h2>
	    <p>We created an array that would take an input number and then
			square the number. We then used a callback to another function that
		  would then take the square root of the new array, and return
			them to their original values.</p>
	  <h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>We had a problem in creating a new operation using the original array.
         we found it kind of difficult to understand this syntax.</p>
	  <h2>Results</h2>
			<p>You are viewing the results of our Java and Html work.</p>
