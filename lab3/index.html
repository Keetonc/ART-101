	<h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>The point of this lab was to make a home page to link all the other labs
		in the course that we create. A organized file stucture is important in
		coding, so it is important that we practice the same for the work we will
		be turning in.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>After downloading the file structure it was easy to navigate to the html
		file and make my homepage. I struggled with linking the html to the css when
		cropping the image on the homepage.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>My file is completed, if you are reading this online that means my html
		works.</p>
